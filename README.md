ü§î Challenges Faced
The following challenges were encountered while developing this project:

LazyInitializationException when working with initialization of child categories:

Problem: When displaying the category tree in the /viewTree command, a LazyInitializationException error was thrown because the child category collections were loaded lazily and outside of an active Hibernate session.
Solution: I used collection initialization via the Hibernate.initialize() method before leaving the session, and also considered alternatives such as fetch-join using a JPA query or using entity graphs.
Handling Excel file uploads and downloads:

Problem: The need to import and export categories from and to Excel format required the use of the Apache POI library. Due to the lack of experience with this library, difficulties with parsing and building the document arose.
Solution: I used Apache POI to create and read Excel files, adding manual row and cell processing to correctly handle the hierarchical structure of categories.
Errors when working with Telegram API:

Problem: When interacting with Telegram API, errors occurred when uploading and downloading files. The method of uploading files via the TelegramBots API was difficult due to the lack of documentation on working with large files.
Solution: I replaced the attempt to override the downloadFile() method with the use of the ready-made DefaultAbsSender method for downloading files, which eliminated the problem with overriding the final methods.
Testing integration with the PostgreSQL database:

Problem: It was necessary to correctly configure the connection between the bot and the PostgreSQL database, as well as provide migrations and automatic initialization of the database for tests.
Solution: I used Spring Data JPA with the correct configuration of database migrations and implemented functional tests to check the correct operation of the bot commands.
These challenges helped me gain a deeper understanding of how to work with the Telegram API, Hibernate, and interacting with the database via Spring Data JPA, which improved our understanding of the application architecture and improved the quality of the code.
